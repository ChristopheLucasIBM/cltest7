Overview & Prerequisites Welcome to the IBM Maximo Asset Performance Management (APM) labs. These labs were conceived to: take you through again This picture summarises the main elements of APM and how they are integrated. 1. Generate the data In this Module you will: Create a Device Type and 3 Devices of that Type Generate IoT data for those 3 Devices using an IoT simulation Create Physical & Logical interfaces to send the IoT data to the Monitor data lake Visualise the IoT data in a Watson IoT Platform simple dashboard Before you begin: This Exercise requires that you have completed Exercise 1 Connected Devices 1. Create Device Type & 3 Devices Let's first create a Device Type . From your Monitor Instance Home page, click Connect Devices On the opened Connect menu, click Open Platform Service application in the top-right corner. This will launch the associated Watson IoT Platform in a separate browser tab. Go to the Device Types menu, and click Add Device Type . Enter XY_Asset in the Name and Description fields - where XY are your initials. Note that for the rest of this lab, we will use CL_Asset (e.g. CL for Christophe Lucas). Click Next . On the next Metadata page, enter CL in Model and Manufacturer fields, and enter CL_Asset in Device Class field. The reason why we want to enter values here is to later show how Dimensions can be used in Monitor to slide and dice the data. Click Finish . The below picture shows the 5 previous steps. Now, let's create 3 Devices of type CL_Asset . Stay in the Watson IoT Platform , go to the Browse menu and click Add Device . On the identity page, select your just created CL_Asset as Entity Type and enter CL_Asset_1 in Device ID . Click Next . On the Device Information page, accept the defaults, click Next . On the Security page, accept the defaults, click Next . On the Security page, accept the defaults, click Next . Click Back , and repeat above steps 1 to 5 for 2 more Assets: CL_Asset_2 and CL_Asset_3 . Finally, go to the Browse menu, enter CL_Asset in the Search field, and you will now see your 3 Devices. You have now created the required CL_Asset Device Type and the 3 CL_Asset_1 , CL_Asset_2 and CL_Asset_3 Devices that we will use throughout the labs. The below pictures shows the 7 previous steps. 2. Create IoT Simulation Let's now send data to those 3 Devices ! Using the Watson IoT Platform IoT Simulation capabilities, it is possible to simulate a device and its IoT readings - exactly as if this was a real IoT device really connected to the platform and sending real IoT readings. We are going to use this great functionality as it allows one to literally simulate any asset (e.g. Pump, Engine, Truck, Conveyor Belt - you name it !), any IoT readings and do any demo. For this Lab, we will simulate our 3 CL_Asset_1_2_3 Devices generating the following IoT readings: temperature , vibration , pressure , speed , acceleration , load , torque , starts . You can of course change the IoT reading names and/or their values to fit your demo needs. First of all, make sure that in your Watson IoT Platform , Settings menu, the Activate Device Simulator is ON. Once that is done, you will see a little box in bottom-right of your screen showing 0 Simulation . Click on that 0 Simulation bottom-right box, and click Create Simulation . In the Select or create a device type box, select the CL_Asset device type you earlier created. That will open a window as you can see kit in picture below - let's customize this. In Event type name , enter CLA . in the Schedule field, enter 4 Every Minute . In the Payload , copy-paste the following .json code. Make sure at this stage that the Store events in the data lake box remains unchecked ! Click Save . Click Use Registerd Device , enter CL_Asset in the Pick Device box, select CL_Asset_1 . Repeat for CL_Asset_2 and CL_Asset_3 . You should now start seeing Events flowing in the bottom Events box. Note that the values in the random(35,40) functions can be considered being the 'standard operating conditions' for the given IoT reading. Later on in the lab, we will change those value ranges for short periods of time (i.e. change the temperature ranges from random(35,40) to random(46,49) ) and show how Monitor's out-of-the-box anomaly functions can automatically spot these 'anomalies' which are deviations from the 'standard operating conditions'. { \"temperature\": random(35,40), \"vibration\": random(1,5), \"pressure\": random(20,25), \"speed\": random(15,20), \"acceleration\": random(8,10), \"load\": random(90,110), \"torque\": random(12,14), \"starts\": increment(1,1) } The below pictures shows the 6 previous steps. Great, you now have your 3 CL_Asset_1_2_3 Devices generating IoT readings 4 times every minute. Let's check those readings on a Dashboard. 3. Create Watson IoT Platform Dashboard Let's create a Dashboard so we can see the simulated IoT readings for 1 of our devices: CL_Asset_1 . This Dashboard will allow us to clearly visualise the anomalies earlier mentioned. Still in the Watson IoT Platform , click on the Boards menu. Click Create Board . Name the Board CL_Asset IoT Readings Dashobard . Click Next then Submit . Open the Board. Let's first create a small card which displays the 8 IoT Readings we simulated, getting updated every 15 seconds. Click Add New Card . Select All device properties then CL_Asset_1 , then Next then Submit . Let's now create a card which whos the flow of data. Click Add New Card . Click Line Chart , then select CL_Asset_1 . Click Connect data set . In the event field, select CLA (that is the name of the IoT Simulation we created earlier), then in the Property select temperature . Repeat this for a couple more properties, e.g. vibration and pressure . Click Next , select the XL size, click Next then Submit . Drag and drop the second card next to the first one. Play with the 5 minutes to 24 hours views. The below pictures summarise the previous steps and show what your Dashboard should like. 4. Create Physical & Logical Interfaces So far, we have only generated simulated IoT data. What Monitor uses for all its visualisations and calculations is the data from the data lake . Monitor's data lake is being populated through the use of Physical & Logical interfaces. Let's create those interfaces and populate that data lake ! First let's create the Physical Interface. Still in the Watson IoT Platform , go to the Device Types menu, search then select CL_Asset , then click on the Interface menu. Click Create Physical Interface . Leave the default name CL_Asset_PI , click Next . Click Create event type . Wait 15 seconds or click Use Last Event Cache and you will see the CLA (which corresponds to the IoT Simulation we earlier created) event appear. Click that event, click Add . Cick Done . This picture shows the previous steps and where you should be by now. Let's now create the Logical Interface. Click Create Logical Interface . Leave the default name CL_Asset_LI , click Next . Click Add Property , Select the temperature , click Save . Repeat this for the 7 other IoT readings. Make sure you tick the Allow Additional Properties ON, as that would allow you to add more readings in the future if you wish. Click Next , click no event notifications and change it to All events . Click Apply , then Done . Click Activate twice. This picture shows the previous steps and what your screen should finally look like after you created your Physical & Logical interfaces. 5. Take a break and let some magic happen ... Brilliant ! You have created all that is needed to start monitoring your own IoT data. In the next module, we will check that your data lake is now populated. But first take a break (count 15 minutes at least, but I recommend several hours as all the following reports will show more data), because: some background job needs to run to populate your data lake with your IoT data, via the logical interface you just created. it is good for the IoT Simulation to keep running a bit, so the visualisations that we will build in next module will show data for more than just 1 hour. Also, for Anomaly functions to detect anomalies, 'normal conditions' must first occur 2. Monitor the data 1. Check your IoT data made it to the Monitor data lake Back to the Monitor interface, click Monitor Entities . If you see 3 in Number of Entities , it means that your data did make it to the dat lake. Let's have a look around. Click on CL_Asset . Then click on CL_Asset_1 , then on its Metrics tab. Play with the 'slider' on e.g. acceleration - you can see your data now. Go back to the CL_Asset main page, and click the Data tab. See all your (raw) IoT Metrics & Dimensions. Note that at this stage it is normal to see only a couple points on the graph as we have only been generating data for so long ! Play with the top 'slider' here too. If you see this, so far so good ! 2. Create an Hourly Summary Dashboard Back to the CL_Asset main page, click New Summary . Enter Hourly as your Dashboard title , select Hourly Time grain , click all Dimensions . Click Next . Click all Dat Item , and for just 1 reading e.g. temperature , select all Methods i.e. max , min , mean , std etc. Click Configure Dashboard . Click Create . Note that it will take a couple minutes for your Hourly dashboard is ready, and you will note a Preparing icon during that time. Once it is ready, your dashboard should look like this (with possibly less data points depending on how fast you have been to get here and for how long data has been sent). Notice the hourly grain of the cards (vs. the shorter time grain that you just saw on the CL_Asset_1 Metrics tab). On the left side in Summary Controls , notice the so-called Dimensions that correspond to the Metadata we associated to the CL_Asset Device Type and 3 Devices when we created them in the Watson IoT Platform. Notice how you can change the 'time scope' of each card. Finally, also notice how the temperature card displays the max , min , mean etc that we defined via the Methods and how you can click on 1 or several of these. 3. Explore the Data & create new Data Items Back to the CL_Asset main page, click on the Data tab. Observe that new Data Items have appeared, i.e. under the Metric (Calculated) section. Notice that for all the IoT Readings, a new reading_Hourly_mean calculated metric was created - this was automatically done when we crated the hourly dashboard in previous step. In the filer just below Data Item , start writing temp . This filters the data items displayed. Note that for the temperature reading, on top of the mean data item, temperature_Hourly_min , temperature_Hourly_max , temperature_Hourly_std etc were also created - that is because of the 8 Methods that we earlier selected for that data item when creating the dashboard. 4. Create some anomalous IoT Readings Remember 2. Create IoT Simulation 5. [OPTIONAL] Understand Monitor's Anomaly Detection capabilities Although this section is optional, I highly recommend it. This is a full Lab on itself, and plan 2 to 3 hours to complete it. You can access it here: Monitor Anomalies . In this deep-dive lab, you will: view 3 great short Youtube movies explaining all the ins and outs of anomaly detection cdcd 6. Create Anomaly Detection functions on your IoT data 7.
